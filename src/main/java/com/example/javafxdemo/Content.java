     * The related FXML currently acts as a placeholder and by extension so does this.
     * I'm thinking there should be a general layout for content which is dynamically updated at each stage.
     * Maybe a couple different versions of it to keep things fresh and accommodate for changes.
     * This will be shown between each exercise. Exercise content could be read in from a file(?)
     *
     * Similarly, I'm thinking each type of exercise should have its own "content" with a standard layout.
     * Each FXML part can then be populated dynamically with the specific content that has just been learned.
     * The type of exercise would be randomly chosen after each piece of teaching, maybe 2 or 3 in a row.
     * Using my current layout this would presumably open in a new window each time - maybe not ideal.
