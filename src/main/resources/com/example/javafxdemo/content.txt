1`-al`-ale`adjectives`normal`general`legal`normale`generale`legale`Many English adjectives that end in the letters 'al' end in 'ale' in Italian. This is not pronounced like the word 'ale' in English, but you pronounce each vowel individually; so, like the 'ah' in 'bra' followed by a clipped version of the 'leh' in 'lazy'. In English, we tend to drag our vowels out more than in Italian, so try and keep it short.`Not all English words follow the same process - for example, some drop the 'al' entirely and end in 'a' or 'o' - and often those that do must also undergo changes we haven't learned about yet - you'll notice that all the examples given so far contain simple sounds which are very close in both languages only.`Remember that all these words are very similar to their English counterparts, but that almost all native Italian words - and all of these - end in a vowel.
2`it/he/she is`è`verbs`she is global`it is natural`he is professional`è globale`è naturale`è professionale`As is common across many Romance languages (the language family Italian belongs to, which also includes French, Spanish and Portugese amongst others), in order to say 'someone or something is...' you usually do not have to explicitly specify who or what you are referring to. Here, we can start with 'è', which sounds like the 'e' in bed, or perhaps slightly more forceful.`Remember that the word 'è' contains an accent, for which a special button is provided. The adjectives follow the same pattern as the others you have seen thus far.
