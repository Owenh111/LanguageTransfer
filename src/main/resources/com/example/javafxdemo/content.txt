This is not pronounced like the word 'ale' in English, but you pronounce each vowel individually; so, like the 'ah' in 'bra' followed by a clipped version of the 'leh' in 'lazy'. In English, we tend to drag our vowels out more than in Italian, so try and keep it short.

Here, we can start with 'è', which sounds like the 'e' in bed, or perhaps slightly more forceful.",""
